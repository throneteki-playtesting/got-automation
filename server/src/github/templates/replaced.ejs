<h3>What needs to be done?</h3>
Old card file & methods need to be removed, and new card needs to be added to this repository, which will require a card file to be created and potentially code implementation.
<em>Non-text box & keyword implementations are automatically processed with updates to [<%= jsonRepoData.name %>](<%- jsonRepoData.link %>).</em>

<h3>Implementation Steps</h3>
1. Create a branch from `development` (you may use a single branch for multiple implementations/updates)
2. Remove the previous card file, and any external methods/files that were created for it
3. Create & implement new card file for this card (within 'server/game/cards/<%= project.short %>')
4. (Important) Set the card version (near bottom of file) to `ReplacementCardClass.version = '<%= replaced.version %>'`
5. (Optional) Test the implementation locally
6. When ready (single or in bulk), create Pull Request into `development` branch, linking this issue in the description as 'Closes: #[this issue number]'
